# What exactly is Next.js?

**Next.js** is a framework for building server-side rendered React websites as well as static websites

So it's categorized as a react front end development framework.
And it was created and it's maintained by a company called Vercel and it allows for server side rendering of your react application.

Not only that, but you can also use it to generate static websites is kind of an alternative to Gatsby,

#### What should you know before learning Next.js?

you should, of course, know JavaScript. You should be pretty comfortable with it, especially modern JavaScript.
Anything that, you know was an E6 like Arrow Functions, D structuring, etc. And I always recommend
knowing JavaScript pretty well before even moving to a framework like react.
Now, in this case, you should also know the basics of react.
You definitely don't have to be a professional react developer


You should know JavaScript basics and modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, restructuring, the spread operator

You should also know the basics of React. You can learn the basics here(Basic React Link)

#### Now, what is server side rendering?

So traditionally, if you use something like, let's say, create react app, what happens is the server just basically passes a JavaScript bundle to the client to be loaded and your entire user interface, your entire front end, it's just ran on the client.

Well, what next does it allows for your react application to actually be rendered on the server on the first page load. 
And this gives gives us a whole bunch of benefits, such as data fetching methods, API routes, better performance. It's also great for SEO because search engines can actually see your content.

#### Is Next.js year a front end framework or a backend framework?

Lot of people are confused if Next.js is frontend framework or backend framework.
It's really both because it's not comparable to something like Xpress because it still does render your entire client side all your react stuff is within next.js. But it also does have backing capabilities to handle requests, response. You can create your own API routes and so on.

So in order to host a full next application, the server does have to have node installed unless you're going to generate a static Web site, which you can also do with next.

### Other benefits
- Now you get some other benefits with next JS right out of the box. We have easy page routing. There's no need to install reactor Autodom and manually create your roots. You simply just put a component into a pages folder.

- We can also create our own API routs and we'll be using this within our project to set in the only cocky for our adjacent web tokens

- You have out of the box TypeScript and SAS. So if you want to use TypeScript, you can just rename your JS files to TS and if it returns Jasiek. So if it's a react component, you would use the TSX extension and then you could use TypeScript. 
- we can also generate static Web sites similar to how Gatsby works.
- For deployment, you have a bunch of options. If it's a static Web site that you generate, you can host it anywhere, including a CDN.

### Thats it for now. You will need to edit this before you post it

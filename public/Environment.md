# Environment and Tools

In this tutorial we will show you some of the tools we use for development environment.
For the code editor, we use VS Code. In VS Code for the Next.js web development, we use some extensions to make our development processes easier.
- ES7 React Extension:  to generate React components, snippets, and Next.js pages so we don't have to type them out
- Bracket Pairs Colorizer: to colorize curly braces, parentheses, and brackets
- Auto Rename Tag: to auto rename the ending tag with the beginning tag
- Peacocke: to colorizing the sidebar for the back end text editor
- Prettier: to format my code
- GitHub dark theme: to basically show anything that hasn't been committed will be colored in here.

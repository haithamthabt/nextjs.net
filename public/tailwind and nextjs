### Tailwind color issue
This issue I faced when I tried to assign color as a variable class 
```javascript

<div className ="bg-${colorKey[children]}-600 text-bold">

```

So as you can see I have a variable that can change, but tailwind only accepts the first input and then for the rest it does not work. 
One way to solve this is by not combining the class with the variable as string concatinating. But it should be as one string from the begening.
